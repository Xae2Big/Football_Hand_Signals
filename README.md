Football Hand Signs
Uses AI vision to detect what fingers are up and what fingers are down and based on the orientation will output different football plays.

The Algorithm
My program utilizes mediapipe and opencv to detect the position of each finger through, therefore it is inputted through a live camera and I used math to improve detection to tell when fingers are bent or when they are extended. 
Running this project
Copy the code into a file and press play I’m not gonna lie
You’re gonna wanna install mediapipe vers 0.10.18 and opencv-python vers 4.11.086
